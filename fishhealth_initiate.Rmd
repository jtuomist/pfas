This is an open assessment looking at potential health effects of a national fish promotion program in Finland. The details of the assessment are described at [Opasnet](http://fi.opasnet.org/fi/PFAS-yhdisteiden tautitaakka). This file contains the R code to run the assessment model.

This file initiates the model ovariables and fetches the necessary data and objects from Opasnet. The next code, fishhealth.Rmd, runs the model and plots various graphs and tables about the results.

Calculation is based on BONUS GOHERR project and its [fish health benefit-risk assessment](http://en.opasnet.org/w/Goherr_assessment).

What has been done for PFAS assessment?

1. Amount should be gender and age-specific, because we need to worry about young mothers. Solution: take KKE amounts of fish, and scale those with the Goherr subgroup-specific proportions. DONE. Not age-specific atm.
2. Amounts should reflect the actual fish consumption in Porvoo. Solution: postpone and use national statistics. DONE
3. Infant's dioxin concentration module must be added. Solution: Use Goherr model for expo_indir DONE
4. The module must be updated to match PFAS as well. Solution: update the module to contain column Exposure_agent. Change body fat parameter to volume of distribution. DONE but not checked. 
5. Find why expo_indir is so much higher than EFSA toxicokinetic assessment. Make an alternative model. Solution: problem was with too high absorption fractions, probably. DONE
6. Add ERF for PFAS (sum of PFOS, PFHxS, PFOA, PFNA). Solution: Make a new page for ERF of PFAS and add that to adjusted ERFs. First immunology; postpone cholesterol and low birth weight and liver toxicity. DONE
7. Add case burdens for PFAS outcomes. Solution: give rough estimates for immunology to get started. DONE
8. Add PFAS concentrations to data. Solution: Look at Porvoo concentrations first and make conc_pfas; combine that with conc_vit. DONE
9. Add dioxin and MeHg concentrations. DONE
10. Now that the model runs technically, look through each part to check that it makes sense. DONE
11. If PAF contains some inputs with Age and some without Age (implying that they apply to any age group), only the explicit age groups remain in the end. Solution: Add RRorig to compensate for this. DONE
12. TEQ and MeHg are missing from dose. Check why and correct. DONE
13. The proportions of All-cause mortality and CHD2 mortality are 3:1 in [Kotimaisen kalan edistämisohjelma](http://fi.opasnet.org/fi/Kotimaisen_kalan_edist%C3%A4misohjelma) but 3:2 in this analysis. Why? Probably omega3-concentration is higher here. Solution: Consider double counting, should the overlap be handled in some way? Also, CHD2 mortality ERF is non-linear, and here these is no background intake. Solution: add background. DONE
14. In exposure, ALA + DHA < Omega3. Why? Because the values come directly from Fineli and probably omega3 contains other fatty acids as well. DONE
15. BoDattr: age group 45 - 50 is way smaller than any other group. Why? Solution: it's the misplaces 5-9-year age group. DONE
16. conc_mehg does not contain Iter although it is probabilistic. Solution: Update formula. DONE
17. TEQ response for cancer morbidity is way too large. Why? Is there a unit problem? Let's look at age group 45-49. BoD 3800, BoDattr 970, dose (Female) 188, CSF 0.0005, incidence 0.00657, population (Female) 154000. This makes case burden = BoD / I / P = 3800/0.00657/154000 = 3.7 DALY/case which is ten times higher than Goherr case burden 0.39 DALY/case. The reason is that the former is about life-time exposure while the latter is per one-year exposure, which is the correct way. The current PAF implies that 21 and 31 % of cancers in females and males, respectively are caused by TEQ in all age groups. That's an artifact also from the lifetime vs yearly mismatch. DONE
18. Related to cancer yearly-lifetime mismatch, also case burden must be corrected. No need, because data comes from InpBoD. DONE
19. MeHg exposure is ca. 2 ug/d when you would assume 1 mg/kg * 0.03 kg/d = 30 ug/d. Where is the difference? Because average fish only 0.1 mg/kg. In addition, salmon is missing. DONE
20. Sperm concentration and dental defect show fairly large BoD. This is because the ERFs have exposure units pg/g, while the exposure has pg/d. Solution: implement the expo_indir submodule. DONE
21. Why is average fish so much higher with PFAS concentration than other fish species and the expectation? Because individual samples are accidentally summed, not bootstrapped. Solution: update formula for conc_pfas. DONE
22. Incorrect levels(Age). DONE
23. expo_indir for TEQ is still unrealistically high. Solution: adjust parameters lower. DONE
24. RR has column Exposure: Direct. This is redundant? Well, it comes from dose (and from exposure). It makes no harm. DONE
25. PAF of TEQ TWI is -7 and TWI 2018 is 2. How come? ERF, incidence, and case_burden seem to be OK. Solution: There are parentheses missing from formula of PAF. Corrected. DONE
26. Take [EFSA food database](https://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/data/dataset/the-efsa-comprehensive-european-food-consumption-database) and derive Finnish fish consumption distributions. DONE
27. Age group undefined should go to the respective ages. Solution: Exposure should be age-specific. Then "undefined" could be removed. Also, correct incidence not to contain "undefined". DONE
28. PFAS BoD (BoDattr?) TWI is 0. Why? Some people should exceed it. Or is it due to lack of variability? Solution: Not any more. I don't know what changed. DONE
29. TEQ sperm concentration effect is surprisingly large. Why? Solution: Probably was due to age group mismatch. Now seens OK. DONE
30. Exposure graph should be age-specific. DONE
31. Fish consumption graph should be age-specific. DONE
32. Many graphs get numbers wrong when openv$N>1. Solution: use trim. DONE
33. Breast cancer, Vitamin D recommendation, and depression go to positive side although they are benefits. Why? It is a plotly thing, as the bars continue from the previous bar and therefore stack in a strange way. Solution: use ggplot for publishable graphs. DONE
34. Fish-specific concentrations are constants. Why? Because of data. PFAS and MeHg are probabilistic, and that is enough. DONE
35. MeHg concentration is lognormal and logSD may be > 1.7, i.e. there may easily be >1000-fold concentration differences. Solution: There was a unit conversion error in data.frame Hg. This was corrected. DONE
36. Remove PFAS and dioxin TWI from the final graphs. DONE
37. Vitamin D goes to positive side although it is a benefit. Solution: Exposcen was missing. DONE
38. Sperm concentration occurs also in women. Solution: add Gender to case_burden. DONE
39. Sperm concentration is in BoD but missing in BoDattr. Solution: Bring back to ERFchoice. DONE
40. All-cause and CHD mortality are double counting. Solution: subtract CHD from all-cause. DONE
41. MeHg IQ effect is surprisingly large. Why? The exposure increased as salmon and rainbow trout concentrations became available, but still it is bigger than expected. PAF is 110 % so this cannot be. The reason is that the response is based on mother's intake, and not it is allocated to the child. Solution: Use the mother - infant model anyway but use mother's hair concentration as the output. DONE
42. Herring - TEQ in conc turns into NA because of a factor mismatch. Solution: converted to character vector. DONE
43. Pike is missing from amount although it is an important source of MeHg. Solution: do nothing. DONE
44. All salmonids inherit the concentrations from Baltic salmon. Solution: Do nothing, wait for the grand Bayesian model. DONE
45. Porvoo and Vanhankaupungilahti should not affect concentrations of fish from other areas. Add higher concentrations to conc using a decision. Add local fish to amount using Inpamount with dimensions Fish and Fishing (with BAU 0 g/d). Correct Fishing locations will be added with oapply. DONE.
46. Fraction of zero PFAS exposure is too high (around 75 %). Should be close to 50 %. Solution: the fish species adjustment has to be moved from expo_dir to amount. DONE
